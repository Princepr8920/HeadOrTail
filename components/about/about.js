            Heads or tails is a simple way to choose between two options. It is
            often used as a fair way to decide something when there are two
            equally desirable options. To flip a coin, a coin is thrown into the
            air and allowed to land on a flat surface, with the outcome (heads
            or tails) determined by which side of the coin is facing up when it
            comes to rest. Coin flipping can also be simulated using a random
            number generator. For example, if you want to flip a coin in a
            computer program, you can use a random number generator to generate
            either a 0 or a 1, with 0 representing heads and 1 representing
            tails. Coin flipping is often used in situations where a completely
            random outcome is desired, such as in games of chance or in
            scientific experiments. It is also sometimes used as a simple way to
            make a decision when there are two equally desirable options.
